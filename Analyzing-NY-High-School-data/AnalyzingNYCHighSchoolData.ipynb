    "The [\"SAT\" (Scholastic Aptitude Test)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT) is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it. The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points.Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",

    "There is controversy around this test (and other standardized tests) though: are they unfair to certain groups?\n",

    "In this study we will investigate correlations between SAT scores and demographics like race, gender, income, and more.\n"
